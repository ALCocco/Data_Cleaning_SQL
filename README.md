# Introduction

These 10 SQL queries were designed to extract insights from data related to worldwide COVID-19 deaths between 1/5/2020 and 1/7/2024. As an exploratory project, each query is meant to answer a specific question. Should you wish to explore the data yourself, there is a copy of the original Excel file in this repository.
