# COVID-19 Data Exploration and Cleaning with SQL

These 10 SQL queries were designed to extract insights from the Coronavirus Deaths dataset published by "Our World in Data" which 
is a publically available dataset created with data from the WHO. This project is exploratory in nature, each query is meant to answer 
a hypothetical question one would ask about the data. Also, the timeframe for the data begins at 1/5/2020 and ends at 1/7/2024.
